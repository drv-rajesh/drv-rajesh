<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> I know plenty a fact - apparently the largest countable number is a googolplex, and your brain's fusiform gyrus is used for facial recognition - and I love reading stacks of quotes - "Technology is a useful servant but a dangerous master" or "The way I see it, if you want the rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain" - but most importantly, I am a full-stack developer who loves learning something new everyday. </p>

<h2> Portfolio </h2>
<p> All of my experience/projects are available to view on my <a href="https://drv-rajesh.github.io"> website </a> or on the <i> "Repositories" </i> tab of my profile. You can see my best projects by scrolling down to the "Pinned" section of my profile. </p>
<p> <b> What I'm working on </b>
<ul>
  <li> Dirmod - a CLI-based file management system created using Python. </li>
  <li> Pyxercise - a curated list of intensive Python exercises intended to be a workout/interview prep. </li>
  <li> Portfolio Website - constantly updating and making fixes. </li>
</ul>
